          "developerCommentary": "One thing that has always frustrated me while playing Quick Matches is that I generally perform better than most players in my region, and my friend group also tends to outperform others. However, constantly playing one-sided games isn't enjoyable. I don't want to queue for a match only to dominate the other team and ruin their Friday night. I want everyone to have fun, even if they might lose. That's why I believe it's essential to have a mode that allows for a more relaxed experience, without the pressure of mastering all the game mechanics that can lead to unbalanced matches. This mode serves as an alternative to ARAM, providing a more enjoyable and fair experience for everyone."
