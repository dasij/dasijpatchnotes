One of the big things i dislike about how hammer is right now is the idea of not moving while under Siege mode even tho we have a talent that let Hammer move and differently from some other talents it gives the same feeling of playing Cassia and not picking the active on level 7 it's like a core talent for your gameplay atleast that's how i feel BUT i like the idea of her having trouble to go with the team because she is naturally slower.",
