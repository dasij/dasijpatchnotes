We could buff the shield until it became OP but i would rather not, we could add passive buffs for other skills..for me the best route is to increase the number of times you can use Sound Barrier while also preventing Lucio Players from losing their momentum while performing good ultimates.",

The second reason is to increase options with that ultimate, making it work like an extra Push Off dash could even change it to something more agressive depending on what position you are. Lastly i wanted to go through that route because it makes me feel like something a Lucio player would want..NON STOPPING SPEED",
