Currently, he faces two serious problems: one where one of his ultimates is basically losing a talent by picking it, and the other is that his talents have been molded into a funnel shape. What I mean is that there is little room for variability in Gul'dan's talents, especially if you choose to go for the <vanilla, abilities, basic, 1> build. What I initially thought could be something simple, I realized how difficult it is to change his talents without altering his entire structure and completely changing how Gul'dan should choose his talents, since the talents themselves are not necessarily bad or uncreative and with that i will probally kill some builds and i will instead make it a more all-rounded mage to preserve something i really like on Heroes of the Storm talent tree system and that's the possibility of mixing builds.",
