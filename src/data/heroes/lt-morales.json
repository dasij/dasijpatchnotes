After considering these opinions, I agree with the players: Morales feels more like a tool for the team rather than a hero. You lack agency, and your role is reduced to a walking bot that simply presses Q on someone. The changes I propose are inspired by what I consider the ideal <vanilla, abilities, basic, 0> character, the TF2 Medic. I aim to give Morales a similar level of agency and introduce some risks.",
